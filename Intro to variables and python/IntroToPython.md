#### **1. What is Python?**

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, which makes it easier for beginners to learn and understand.

**Key Features of Python:**

- **Easy to Read and Write:** Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, making it easier to learn and write code.

- **Interpreted Language:** Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.

- **Dynamically Typed:** You don't need to declare the type of a variable when you write code. The type is assigned during runtime.

- **Open Source:** Python is free to use, and its source code is open for anyone to view or modify.

- **Extensive Libraries:** Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that make it versatile for various applications.

**Example:**

```python

# Simple Python program to print a message

print("Hello, World!")

```
